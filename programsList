Solve using functions
1. Accept full name and display in reverse order with space between the words.
2. Accept a list of single digit numbers as input string. Concatenate the elements of the
list as a single number.
3. Write a program to search an item in a given list and display the number of occurrences
of the given item.
4. Write a program to print all even numbers from a given list in the given order until you reach number 237 or end of the list.
5. Write a program to remove all odd indexed characters from a given string.
6. Write a program that count the number of strings where string length is 2 or more and the
first and last characters are same.
7. Write a program that counts odd and even numbers in a given list.
8. Write a function to get a new string from a given string by adding ‘Is’ to the beginning
of the input string. If the given string already begins with ‘Is’, return the input string
unchanged.
9. Write lambda functions:
(a) To find largest of 2 numbers
(b) To check the input number is divisible by 5
(c) To remove all strings with length < 5 from a list of strings
(d) To increment a list of integers by 10% if the number is greater than 1000 else by 5%.
10. Write lambda functions, each to find area of square, rectangle and triangle.
11. Write recursive functions to (a) find the factorial of a number (b) find the nth
Fibonacci number (c) find the sum of an integer list (d) find the sum of first N whole
numbers (e) reverse a string.
